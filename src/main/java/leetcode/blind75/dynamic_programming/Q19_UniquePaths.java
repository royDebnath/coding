/**
 * There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]).
 * The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]).
 * The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
 *
 * Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take
 * to reach the bottom-right corner.
 *
 * The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.
 * 000
 * 000
 * 000
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: m = 3, n = 2
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
 * 1. Right -> Down -> Down
 * 2. Down -> Down -> Right
 * 3. Down -> Right -> Down
 *
 *
 *Solution :
 *
 * This question solved by Dynamic Programming.
 *
 * Find the base case:
 *
 * There is only one way to reach the left most edge and there is only one way to reach the bottom most edge.
 * So we init the first row and first column of 2D list with 1.
 *
 * 1,1,1,1,1,1,1
 * 1,x,x,x,x,x,x
 * 1,x,x,x,x,x,x
 * 1,x,x,x,x,x,x
 *
 * Find the pattern:
 *
 * The robot can only move either down or right. For each target cell that the robot want to reach,
 * it is either from left cell of the tagret or from up cell of the target.
 * Therefor we need sum up targetâ€™s left cell and up cell to get the total path to reach the target cell.
 *
 * 1,1,1,1, 1 , 1 , 1
 * 1,2,3,4, 5 , 6 , 7
 * 1,3,6,10,15,21,28
 * 1,x,x,x,x,x,x
 *
 * Answer:
 *
 * When reach to the bottom-right corner, then number in the bottom-right corner will be the answer.
