 * Problem Description
 * The problem is to create an algorithm that can efficiently search for a specific value,
 * called target, within a 2-dimensional matrix. The dimensions of the matrix are m x n,
 * which means it has m rows and n columns. The matrix is not just any random assortment
 * of integersâ€”it has two key properties that can be leveraged to make searching efficient:
 *
 * Each row of the matrix is sorted in ascending order from left to right.
 *
 * Each column of the matrix is sorted in ascending order from top to bottom.
 *
 * Given these sorted properties of the matrix, the search should be done in a way
 * that is more optimized than a brute-force approach which would check every element.
 *
 * Intuition
 * To intuitively understand the solution, we should recognize that
 * because of the row and column properties, the matrix resembles a 2D binary search problem.
 * However, instead of splitting our search space in half each time as we would in a conventional
 * binary search, we can make an observation:
 *
 * If we start in the bottom-left corner of the matrix (or the top-right),
 * we find ourselves at an interesting position:
 * moving up decreases the value (since columns are sorted in ascending order from top to bottom),
 * and moving right increases the value (since rows are sorted in ascending order from left to right).
 * This starting point gives us a "staircase" pattern to follow based on comparisons:
 *
 * If the target is greater than the value at our current position,
 * we know it can't be in the left in the current row,
 * so we move to the right (increase the column index).
 *
 * If the target is less than the value at our current position,
 * we know it can't be in the below in the current column, so we move up (decrease the row index).
 *
 * By doing this, we are eliminating either a row or a column at each step,
 * leveraging the matrix's properties to find the target or conclude it's not there.
 * We keep this up until
 * we find the target or exhaust all our moves (when we move out of the bounds of the matrix),
 * in which case the target is not present.
 * This is why the while loop condition in the code checks if i >= 0 and j < n.
 *
 *
 * We can choose to start with any of the position, top-right or bottom-left.
 * These two positions are interesting because from any of this position,
 * the matrix looks like a bst :
 *
 * for bottom left : right side is greater, up side is lesser
 * for top right: left side is lesser, down side is greater
 *
 * Solution Approach
 * The solution provided is a direct implementation of the intuitive strategy discussed previously.
 * Here's how the solution is implemented:
 *
 * We declare a Solution class with a method searchMatrix that accepts a 2D matrix and the target value
 * as parameters.
 *
 * Inside the searchMatrix method, we start by getting the dimensions of the matrix:
 * m for the number of rows and n for the number of columns,
 * which will be used for boundary checking during the search.
 *
 * We initiate two pointers, i and j, which will traverse the matrix.
 * i is initialized to m - 1, which means it starts from the last row (bottom row),
 * and j is initialized to 0, which is the first column (leftmost column).
 * This represents the bottom-left corner of the matrix.
 *
 * The search begins and continues as long as our pointers are within the bounds of the matrix.
 * The while loop condition makes sure that i is never less than 0 (which would mean we've moved above the first row) and j is less than n (to ensure we don't move beyond the last column to the right).
 *
 * Within the loop, there are three cases to consider:
 *
 * If the element at the current position matrix[i][j] equals the target, then our search is successful, and we return True.
 * If the element at matrix[i][j] is greater than the target, we must move up (decrease the value of i) to find a smaller element.
 * Conversely, if matrix[i][j] is less than the target, we must move right (increase the value of j) in hopes of finding a larger element.
 * If we exit the loop without returning True, it means we have exhausted all possible positions in the matrix without finding the target, and thus we return False.
 *
 * This approach effectively traverses the matrix in a manner such that with each comparison, a decision can be made to eliminate either an entire row or an entire column, significantly reducing the search space and making the algorithm efficient. The worst case scenario would be traversing from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner, which gives us a time complexity of O(m + n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.
 *
 * Example Walkthrough
 * Let's walk through a small example to illustrate the solution approach. Consider the following 3x4 matrix and a target value to search for:
 *
 * [ [1, 4, 7, 11],
 *   [2, 5, 8, 12],
 *   [3, 6, 9, 16] ]
 * And let's say we are searching for the target value 5.
 *
 * Using the solution approach, we start at the bottom-left corner of the matrix. This means our starting position is at the last row, first column: matrix[2][0], which is 3.
 *
 * Now, we compare the target value 5 with the value at our current position:
 *
 * target (5) > matrix[2][0] (3) so the target can't be in the current row because all values to the left are smaller. We move right to increase the value (increment j): now we are at matrix[2][1], which is 6.
 *
 * target (5) < matrix[2][1] (6) so the target can't be in the current column because all values below are larger. We move up to decrease the value (decrement i): now we are at matrix[1][1], which is 5.
 *
 * At this point, matrix[1][1] equals the target value 5, so our search is successful, and we return True.
 *
 * This approach avoided checking every single element in the matrix, instead, by leveraging the sorted nature of the rows and columns, it quickly hones in on the target with a clear strategy. Even if the target number was not present, the process would eventually move out of the matrix bounds, at which point we would return False, signifying that the target is not found.
