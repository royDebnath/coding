/**
 * Problem Description
 * The problem is about finding a common intersection node (if one exists) for two singly linked lists.
 * These lists may completely diverge, in which case no intersection occurs,
 * or they can share a common sequence of nodes. The point at which they start to intersect
 * becomes their intersection node. This problem does not consider linked lists with cycles and the
 * structural integrity of the lists must remain unchanged after the function executes.
 *
 * Intuition
 * The challenge is to compare two singly linked lists of potentially different lengths and
 *
 * Intuitively, if you traverse both lists in tandem, they will reach the intersection point
 * at the same time if they are of the same length. However, when they're of different lengths,
 * simply traversing them simultaneously won't work because
 * one pointer will reach the end before the other.
 * The key insight here is to switch lists when one pointer reaches the end.
 *
 * This way, both pointers end up covering the extra distance on the longer list and
 * hence reconcile any difference in lengths.
 *
 * Concretely, the solution involves two pointers,
 * starting at headA and headB respectively.
 * They each move forward one node at a time.
 * When one pointer reaches the end of its list,
 * it continues from the beginning of the other list.
 * If there is an intersection,
 * the pointers will meet at the intersection node after traversing lengthA + lengthB nodes
 * (where lengthA is the length of list A including the intersection, and lengthB is the length of list B
 * including the intersection). If there is no intersection, both pointers will eventually be null
 * after the same number of steps, effectively also reaching the end of a hypothetically combined list.
 *
 * Solution Approach
 * The implementation of the solution makes use of the two-pointer technique.
 * The algorithm involves keeping two pointers, a and b, initially set to headA and headB respectively.
 * Both a and b traverse the respective linked lists simultaneously.
 * If any of the pointers reaches the end of its linked list, it is reassigned to the head of the other
 * linked list.
 * This swapping of starting points after reaching the end ensures that the two pointers will eventually
 * traverse equal distances even if the linked lists have different lengths.
 *
 *
 * Example Walkthrough
 * Let's assume we have two singly linked lists that intersect at some node:
 *
 * List A: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
 * List B:           9 -> 4 -> 5
 * Here, nodes with values 4 and 5 are shared among both lists, making node 4 the intersection point.
 *
 * Now, we will walk through the two-pointer strategy using this example.
 *
 * Initialize two pointers:
 *
 * Pointer a at the head of List A (1)
 * Pointer b at the head of List B (9)
 * Move each pointer forward one node at a time:
 *
 * Move a to 2, move b to 4.
 * Continue moving forward:
 *
 * Move a to 3, move b to 5.
 * Move a to 4, and since pointer b has no next node, it moves to the head of List A (1).
 * Keep proceeding with the traversal:
 *
 * Since pointer a has no next node, it moves to the head of List B (9).
 * Move b to 2.
 * Continue the process:
 *
 * Pointer a moves to 4, pointer b moves to 3.
 * At this point, the crucial step occurs:
 *
 * Pointer a is now at the node with the value 4 on List B.
 * Pointer b moves to 4 in List A (since b was previously at 3).
 * The pointers now meet at the node with value 4, which is the intersection node.
 *
 * The loop has exited because a is equal to b, signifying that the intersection node has been found.
 * The output of our algorithm will be the node with the value 4 as it's the point of intersection.
 *
 * In this example, each pointer traversed:
 *
 * Pointer a: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 9 -> 4
 * Pointer b: 9 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
 * This shows that after pointer b traversed its own list,
 * and part of List A, and pointer a traversed its own list, and part of List B,
 * they met at the intersection node.
 * Thus, they have traversed equal lengths, which is the basis of our algorithm â€“
 * having each pointer cover the length of both lists, regardless of their initial lengths.
