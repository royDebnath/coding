/**
 * Problem Description
 * The task is to find the diameter of a binary tree.
 * The diameter is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree,
 * which does not necessarily have to involve the root node.
 * Here, the length of the path is given by the number of edges between the nodes.
 * Therefore, if a path goes through the sequence of nodes A -> B -> C,
 * the length of this path is 2 since there are two edges involved (A to B and B to C).
 * 
 * Intuition
 * To solve this problem, we use a depth-first search (DFS) approach.
 * The intuition behind using DFS is to explore as far as possible down each branch before backtracking,
 * which helps in calculating the depth (or height) of each subtree rooted at node.
 * 
 * For every node, we compute the depth of its left and right subtrees,
 * which are the lengths of the longest paths from this node to a leaf node down the
 * left and right subtrees, respectively.
 * The diameter through this node is the sum of these depths,
 * as it represents a path from the deepest leaf in the left subtree,
 * up to the current node,
 * and then down to the deepest leaf in the right subtree.
 * 
 * The key is to recognize that the diameter at each node is the sum of the left and right subtree depths,
 * and we are aiming to find the maximum diameter over all nodes in the tree.
 * Hence, during the DFS, we keep updating a global or external variable with the maximum diameter
 * found so far.
 * 
 * One crucial aspect of the solution is that for every DFS call,
 * we return the depth of the current subtree to the previous caller (parent node)
 * in order to compute the diameter at the parent level.
 * The current node depth is calculated as 1 + max(left, right),
 * accounting for the current node itself plus the deeper path among its left or right subtree.
 * 
 * This approach allows us to travel only once through the tree nodes,
 * maintaining a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
 * 
 *
 * Solution Approach
 * To implement the diameter calculation for a binary tree, we use DFS to traverse the tree.
 * Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm used in the provided code:
 * 
 * Define the dfs Function:
 * This recursive function takes a node of the tree as an argument.
 * Its purpose is to compute the depth of the subtree rooted at that node and
 * update the ans variable with the diameter passing through that node.
 * 
 * Base Case: If the current node is None, which means we've reached beyond a leaf node,
 * we return a depth of 0.
 * 
 * Recursive Search: We calculate the depth of the left subtree (left) and
 * the depth of the right subtree (right) by making recursive calls to dfs(root.left) and dfs(root.right).
 * 
 * Update Diameter: We update the ans variable (which is declared with the nonlocal keyword
 * to refer to the ans variable in the outer scope) with the maximum of its current value and
 * the sum of left and right. This represents the largest diameter found
 * at the current node because it is the sum of the path through the
 * left child plus the path through the right child.
 * 
 * Returning Depth: Each call to dfs returns the depth of the subtree it searched.
 * The depth is the maximum between the depths of its left and right subtrees,
 * increased by 1 to account for the current node.
 * 
 * Start DFS: We call dfs starting at the root node to initiate the depth-first search of the tree.
 * 
 * Return the Result: After traversing the whole tree, ans holds the length of the longest path,
 * which is the diameter of the binary tree.
 * 
 * The overall complexity of the solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree
 * since each node is visited exactly once.
 * 
 * This solution uses a DFS pattern to explore the depth of each nodeâ€™s subtrees and a
 * global or "helper" scope variable to track the cumulative maximum diameter found
 * during the entire traversal. The use of recursion and tracking a global maximum is a
 * common strategy for tree-based problems where computations in child nodes need to influence
 * a result variable at a higher scope.
 * 
 *
 * Example Walkthrough
 * Let's walk through an example to illustrate the solution approach using the depth-first search (DFS)
 * algorithm to find the diameter of a binary tree.
 * 
 * Consider a binary tree:
 * 
 *    1
 *   / \
 *  2   3
 * / \
 *4   5
 * In this example, the longest path (diameter) is between node 4 and node 3,
 * which goes through node 2 and node 1. Here's how we can apply the solution approach to this tree:
 * 
 * We start DFS with the root node. Let's call dfs(1):
 * 
 * It's not None, so we continue with the recursion.
 * We encounter node 1 and make recursive calls to its left and right children:
 * 
 * dfs(2) is called for the left subtree.
 * dfs(3) is called for the right subtree.
 * Inside dfs(2):
 * 
 * We call dfs(4) for the left child and return 1 (since 4 is a leaf node).
 * We call dfs(5) for the right child and return 1 (since 5 is a leaf node).
 * We update ans to be max(ans, left + right) which at this point is max(0, 1 + 1) = 2.
 * We return 1 + max(left, right) to indicate the depth from node 2 to the deepest leaf
 * which equals 1 + 1 = 2.
 *
 * Inside dfs(3):
 * 
 * Since node 3 is a leaf node, we return 1.
 * Back to the dfs(1), with the returned values:
 * 
 * We received 2 from the left subtree (dfs(2)).
 * We received 1 from the right subtree (dfs(3)).
 *
 * We update ans with the sum of the left and right which is max(2, 2 + 1) = 3.
 * This is the diameter passing through the root.
 *
 * DFS is called throughout the entire tree, and the maximum value of ans is updated accordingly.
 * 
 * Since we've traversed the whole tree, the final ans is 3,
 * which is the length of the longest path (diameter) in our binary tree,
 * passing from node 4 to 3 via nodes 2 and 1.
 * 
 * The key steps in the example above show the recursive nature of the solution,
 * updating a global maximum diameter as the recursion unfolds,
 * and the use of depth calculations to facilitate this process.
 * The time complexity is O(N) as we visit each node exactly once in the process.
