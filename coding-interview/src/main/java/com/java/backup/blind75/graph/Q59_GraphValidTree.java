/**
 * Problem: Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n â€” 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes),
 * write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.
 * <p>
 * Example(s):
 * <p>
 * Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]], return true.
 * Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]], return false.
 * Show Hint Note: you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges.
 * Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.
 * <p>
 * Solution:
 * <p>
 * A valid Tree should not have a loop/cycle. Every node should be connected.
 * <p>
 * In other words, a tree is an undirected graph which is connected and has no cycles.
 *
 *Code :
 *
 * Create a array of sets of n length, where n is the number of nodes.
 * the index of the array denotes the node of the array
 * the elements of the sets in that index of array denotes the other nodes that are connected to that index node.
 * The above array of sets is the adjacency list representation of the graph
 *
 * create an array of booleans of length n. index of the array denotes the node.
 * name it visited. This keeps record of which nodes are visited.
 *
 * Start a dfs from the 0th node of the graph. recursively keep calling the dfs (hasCycle) to mark the
 * nodes visited to true in the visited[] array by index. also while doing the recursion check if we are
 * encountering a node which is already visited, that means the graph has a cycle. While checking if a node is
 * already visited or not we need to exclude the parent node, as it will obviously be visited by then.
 *
 * If while doing the dfs we find out the graph has a cycle then its not a tree.
 *
 * If at the end of the dfs, check the visited[] array. if any node is not visited then its not a tree. *
