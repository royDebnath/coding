	 * Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly
	 * affair and requires a lot of time and resources and you have a similar
	 * object already existing.Suppose we have an Object that loads data from
	 * database. Now we need to modify this data in our program multiple times,
	 * so it’s not a good idea to create the Object using new keyword and load
	 * all the data again from database.
	 * 
	 * The better approach would be to clone the existing object into a new
	 * object and then do the data manipulation.
	 * 
	 * Prototype design pattern mandates that the Object which you are copying
	 * should provide the copying feature. It should not be done by any other
	 * class. However whether to use shallow or deep copy of the Object
	 * properties depends on the requirements and its a design decision.
