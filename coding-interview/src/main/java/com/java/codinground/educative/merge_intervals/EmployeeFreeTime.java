/**
 *
 * We are given a list schedule of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.
 *
 * Each employee has a list of non-overlapping Intervals, and these intervals are in sorted order.
 *
 * Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free time for all employees, also in sorted order.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
 * Output: [[3,4]]
 * Explanation:
 * There are a total of three employees, and all common
 * free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
 * We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
 * Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]
