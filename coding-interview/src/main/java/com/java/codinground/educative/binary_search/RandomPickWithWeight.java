/**
 * Statement
 * You’re given an array of positive integers, weights, where weights[i] is the weight of the
 * �
 * �
 * ℎ
 * i
 * th
 *
 *  index.
 *
 * Write a function, Pick Index(), which performs weighted random selection to return an index from the weights array. The larger the value of weights[i], the heavier the weight is, and the higher the chances of its index being picked.
 *
 * Suppose that the array consists of the weights
 * [
 * 12
 * ,
 * 84
 * ,
 * 35
 * ]
 * [12,84,35]
 * . In this case, the probabilities of picking the indexes will be as follows:
 *
 * Index 0:
 * 12
 * /
 * (
 * 12
 * +
 * 84
 * +
 * 35
 * )
 * =
 * 9.2
 * %
 * 12/(12+84+35)=9.2%
 *
 * Index 1:
 * 84
 * /
 * (
 * 12
 * +
 * 84
 * +
 * 35
 * )
 * =
 * 64.1
 * %
 * 84/(12+84+35)=64.1%
 *
 * Index 2:
 * 35
 * /
 * (
 * 12
 * +
 * 84
 * +
 * 35
 * )
 * =
 * 26.7
 * %
 * 35/(12+84+35)=26.7%
