/**
 * You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
 *
 * 0 representing an empty cell,
 * 1 representing a fresh orange, or
 * 2 representing a rotten orange.
 * Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1.
 *Solution :
 *First check if the input is invalid.
 * Then, iterate over every cell in the matrix with rotAdjacent if the cell is rotten.
 *
 * In rotAdjacent there has to be bounds checking:
 * 1.) check if we are at the left or right edge
 * 2.) check if we are at the top or bottom edge
 * 3.) check if the cell is empty
 * 4.) check if this cell has already been touched by another depth-first search using rotAdjacent that hit it faster than the original rot we are recursing from currently.
 * In these four cases we just end.
 *
 * Otherwise, we store minutes, which represents the current time-step in the cell. Minutes at the first time step is 2 to offset that values 0 and 1 are reserved to indicate empty and fresh cells. Then we recursively invoke rotAdjacent on all adjacent cells, left, right, top, and bottom.
 *
 * By starting recursive rotting from each rotten cell, we can see if it is possible to spread adjacently to all fresh cells. After we finish with all the rotAdjacent, we return to orangesRotting, and check if there's any fresh cells left, in which case we fail.
 *
 * Otherwise, we get the largest value from the grid, which represents the timestep at which the final fresh cell was rotted, remove the offset of 2, and return.
