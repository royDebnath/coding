/**
 * Statement
 * You are required to find an integer t in an array arr of non-distinct integers.
 * Prior to being passed as input to your search function, arr has been processed as follows:
 *
 * It has been sorted in non-descending order.
 * It has been rotated around some pivot k, such that, after rotation, it looks like this:
 * [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]].
 * For example, [10, 30, 40, 42, 42, 47, 78, 90, 901], rotated around pivot k=5
 * becomes [47, 78, 90, 901, 10, 30, 40, 42, 42].
 * Return TRUE if t exists in the rotated, sorted array arr, and FALSE otherwise, while minimizing the number of operations in the search.
