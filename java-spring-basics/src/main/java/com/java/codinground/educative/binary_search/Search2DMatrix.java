 * You are given an m x n integer matrix matrix with the following two properties:
 *
 * Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 * The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
 * Given an integer target, return true if target is in matrix or false otherwise.
 *
 * You must write a solution in O(log(m * n)) time complexity.
